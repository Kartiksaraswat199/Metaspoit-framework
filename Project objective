This project is a backdoor Trojan Using Metasploit framework to create a platform
remotely which allows control of the device windows operating system using the
malicious payload. Penetration testing tools like Metasploit framework has been
used to demonstrate a security test and to check the loopholes of devices. The main
purpose was to study the Metasploit payloads, analyse and control the target device.

This process of generating malicious payload, and performing a security test,
collecting data from the target devices also revealed the different ways adopted by
the cyber-criminals, black-hat hackers to gain access to their target devices like
injecting the payload into an original application.
